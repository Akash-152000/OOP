# OOPS
### Object-Oriented-programming in python

Everything in Python is an object.

There are many different ways, models, or paradigms to write computer programs.

One of the most popular programming paradigms is called object-oriented programming (OOP).

In object-oriented programming, an object refers to a particular instance of a Class.

And a Class is like a blueprint of the state and actions that an object can take.

For example, in Python, a Person Class might look something like this.

'''
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
  
  def get_name(self):
    return self.name
'''
